# 🎓 CareerConnect – Simplifying Campus Placements for Everyone

CareerConnect is a web-based portal we built to make campus placements more streamlined, centralized, and accessible for colleges. It's designed for three key users — Students, TPOs (Training & Placement Officers), and Recruiters — each having their own dedicated space to manage everything from job applications to candidate shortlisting.

We created this to solve a real-world problem that many students and TPOs face: scattered communication, manual processes, and lack of transparency. CareerConnect brings everyone under one roof and makes the whole placement process smoother and faster.

## 🌟 What inspired us?

During our time in college, we noticed how placements were often managed through a mix of spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, and forms. While it works, it's far from efficient. So we asked ourselves — what if there was a platform that handled everything placements-related, from applications to selections, in one place?

That’s when CareerConnect was born.

## 🔐 Security and Login

We’ve implemented **JWT-based authentication** so that each user role (student, TPO, recruiter) has access only to their relevant dashboard. Protected routes, role-check middleware, and secure APIs ensure data separation and safety.
